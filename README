Introduction:
============

Pylyglot is a web based tool for translators. It contains a database of messages and their translations into several different languages that one can search for suggestions.

Installation:
============

* Install dependencies.
* Copy the conf/99-devel.conf.sample file and rename it to 99-devel.conf. By default sqlite is configured to be the engine with a new development.db file.
* Create a po/ directory in the root directory of your checkout.
* Populate the newly created po/ directory with *.po files. Right now the parser expects that *.po files are named in the following format:
    packagename-branchname-language.po

For example, download the French GNOME packages from http://l10n.gnome.org/languages/fr/gnome-2-32/ui.tar.gz and untar it into the po/ directory.

NOTE: This will be changed so that the name of the package is parsed from the *.po header section!

* Create the original database:
    python manage.py syncdb
* Populate the database by parsing the *.po files:
    python manage.py populatedb
* Start the server:
    python manage.py runserver
